# Capital Cities Quiz - Countries and Capitals

## üìÑ Description

This project is a Java program that runs a quiz game about world capitals. The program reads a `countries.txt` file containing a list of countries and their capitals, and stores this information in a `HashMap`. Then, it prompts the user for their name and displays 10 random countries, one by one, asking the user to enter the corresponding capital.

For each correct answer, the user earns one point. After the 10 questions, the user's name and total score are saved in a file called `categories.txt`.
